Create-React-App, or _CRA_, is the "de-facto" starting point for creating React applications. It is supported by Facebook and the React team itself, but it has some drawbacks.

_CRA_ is meant for a single entrypoint, and to be deployed at a static server. It means that if you have a big website with multiple routes, you will find yourself sending your entire front-end application to the client. In Remastered, every route has its own JS chunk, which will be downloaded when the user visits it. No more overfetching and slow mobile experiences!

_CRA_ does not support file-system routing and does not have a built-in router, which is an integral part of any website and system. This means, that in every new project, you will have to choose and implement a routing solution. It is also the reason some some modern don't store the state and routes in the URL, making sharing links harder â€” creating a correlation between modern apps and bad sharing experience. In Remastered, the router is deeply integrated. URLs are not an afterthought. File-system routing is applied to allow you prototype your app as fast as you can!

Since _CRA_ is meant to be statically hosted after build-time, it does not have any notion of data-fetching nor an API endpoint. Therefore, _CRA_ suggests that the front-end team should be separate from the back-end team and will eventually _make shipping harder_. Remastered can be used both ways, but when starting a fresh project, one developer can own the entire stack -- both the front-end AND the back-end, without sacrificing developer experience and user experience.

_CRA_ is using Webpack, a widely used JS bundler. It also uses Babel to transform modern JS and TypeScript into JS code that current browsers can use. In development, _CRA_ will bundle your app so you can work on it locally, with HMR enabled. Bundling your app in development means that Webpack will have to bundle your _entire_ application, making the boot-time very slow and will get slower as your application gets larger. with Remastered, on the other hand, is using [Vite] and [esbuild] to serve, bundle and transform your codebase. In development, Vite acts as an ES-module server and does not bundle your app at all in development, which makes development snappy and fast no matter what size is your app.
