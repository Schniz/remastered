title: Differences from Next.js
link_title: "from Next.js"

Next.js is a wonderful front-end framework, build by Vercel, which is meant to be deployed at the Vercel cloud. Although supporting SSR out-of-the-box, Next.js is mainly a front-end framework, and as such, it does not suggest using `<form>`, and HTTP headers are an afterthought. Remastered knows how your app is built. So it provides a friction-free data fetching, nested routes for better accessibility and fast prototyping, co-located API endpoints which can be used with a simple `<form>` tag.

Next.js' router is a custom router, which does not support nested routes. Remastered is using [React Router], the de-facto standard router for React apps, which supports nested routes, nested layouts, relative links and more advanced features.

Both Next.js and Remastered share the concept of file-system routing. In Remastered, layouts are also nested based on the directory structure, to allow standard onion-layout applications.

Next.js forces you to render the React component every time. In Remastered, you're in full control. If you want to return a redirect, a JSON response a binary file or even a hardcoded HTML string, you are allowed to do so! All you have to do is to return a `Response` from your `loader` function.

Next.js does not come with a built-in support for user sessions. Remastered comes baked with a session solution, since every full-stack app will eventually have some kind of sessions. Remastered also has an open API for adding a custom session storage, so you can store it practically everywhere: from the browser cookies to Redis, through S3 or in-memory or file-system.

Next.js does not allow you to opt-out from JavaScript for specific pages (or your entire application). In Remastered, it is as easy as removing `<Scripts />` from your layout component.

Next.js comes with `styled-jsx` as a default CSS in JS solution. Remastered supports global CSS and CSS modules out of the box (by leveraging Vite). This means that integrating [tailwindcss] is as easy as `import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'`.
