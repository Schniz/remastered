              The web is focused around hyperlinks. Remastered embraces URLs as
              the most important building block. Use file-system routing to
              declare URLs, and allow customers to share the experience of your
              app with the world.
            </Feature>
            <Feature icon={CogIcon} title="Server-side rendered SPA">
              Make sure your app loads as fast as it can, with no jitter and
              "flash of unstyled content". Remastered serves your application
              ready for action, even before JavaScript loads. And when it loads,
              it acts as if you were building a single-page-application,
              providing the great modern user-experience your customers expect
              from a modern web-app.

            <Feature icon={SparklesIcon} title="Convenient data fetching">
              Instead of throwing useEffect everywhere, In Remastered, every
              Route might expose a co-located server-side data loader which gets
              fetched automatically and stored in the history stack. All you
              have to do is call a React hook to get it, synchronously.

              Only ships assets your clients need to interact with the page they
              are visiting. Remastered will download the assets needed for new
              interactions as soon as they are needed.
            </Feature>
            <Feature icon={CodeIcon} title="Titles and Meta Tags">
              The <code>{"<title>"}</code> and the <code>{"<meta>"}</code> are
              the way to share metadata about the current page in the web
              platform. They can't be an afterthought! Remastered takes it very
              seriously and provides and easy way to declare metadata for the
              current page, allowing search engines and screen-readers to easily
              understand what they are going to experience.
