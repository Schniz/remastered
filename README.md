# Remastered

A proof of concept for an open source implementation of Remix.

## Why?

Remix looks like a really fine product. Michael and Ryan do a great job for the React community and I believe their thought should be pushed forward. Some companies and individuals won't embrace Remix because it is closed source â€” many devs want an open stack they can own.

## How?

By leveraging Vite, a super fast bundler with HMR.
